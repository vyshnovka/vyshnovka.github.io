# Portfolio

This is an amazingly simple portfolio webpage with all the important info.
  
It consists of education/experience timeline, thesis skills description and project showcase.    
However, the page is fully customizable, so you can add any information you want.

Everything is done in pure JavaScript, no fancy frameworks except for jQuery.

Feel free to use it as a template, but don't forget to mention me somewhere.
