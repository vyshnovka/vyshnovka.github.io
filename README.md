# Portfolio

This is an amazingly simple portfolio webpage with all the important information.
  
It consists of greeting description, downloadable resume, project showcase and contacts.    
However, the page is fully customizable, so you can add any information you want.

Everything is done using pure JavaScript and a tiny bit of jQuery, so no fancy frameworks.

Feel free to use it as a template, but don't forget to mention me somewhere.
